  This is a list of topic-centric public data sources in high quality. They are collected and tidied from blogs, answers, and user responses. Most of the data sets listed below are free, however, some are not. This project was incubated at OMNILab, Shanghai Jiao Tong University during Xiaming Chen's Ph.D. studies. OMNILab is now part of the BaiYuLan Open AI community. Other amazingly awesome lists can be found in sindresorhus's awesome list.
